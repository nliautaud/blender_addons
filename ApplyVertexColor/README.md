# applyVertexColor

Apply the current color (of the "Draw" brush) to vertices or faces in Edit Mode.

- Pick a color in Vertex Paint
- Select vertices or faces in Edit Mode
- Hit <kbd>V</kbd>

Select faces to apply color without overflowing on the neighbors and keep hard color edges. The vanilla alternative is to select faces, return to Vertex Paint, activate ``face selection masking`` and fill with <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>.
